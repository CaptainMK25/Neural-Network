# Neural Network
## Overview
### This is a neural network project I've been working for a few weeks now. I wanted to create my own neural network library to gain a solid understanding of how this amazing artificial intelligence tool works and be able to experience it, configure it and visualize it. My current goal for this project is to have a versatile and configurable neural network to fit almost all problems that require a neural network. For example, the neural network's nodes, hidden layers, loss functions, activation functions, learning rate are elements I want to be configurable by the user

## Current Development Status
### I have finished the visualization feature of the neural network, it is now capable of rendering a video of itself for the user to view the network they created. Now, I am working on documenting the project, with docstrings, comments and type hinting, since I have recently made this repository public

## Next Steps:
### - Implement a system that allows the nodes to work together so that the network functions, based on the set weights and inputs
### - Visualize the different weights and biases of each node
### - Implement a loss function to show the network how right or wrong its output was
### - Implement a backpropagation algorithm to allow the network to learn from its mistakes and improve
### - Implement a function that allows the network to take in training data and learn from it

## Thank you for checking this project out, I hope you liked it!
